PROJECT DETAILS: MART SALES PREDICTION
This project aims to predict sales based on key variables such as price, advertising budget, and seasonality using a linear regression model. It also evaluates the model's performance and visualizes the relationship between actual and predicted sales.
________________________________________
KEY FEATURES:
1.	Data Loading:
o	The dataset should include columns for price, advertising budget, seasonality, and sales.
o	Replace the sample data with your real dataset (e.g., a CSV file named market_sales_data.csv).
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	The features (Price, Advertising Budget, Seasonality) are used to predict the target variable (Sales).
o	The data is split into training and testing sets.
3.	Model Building:
o	A linear regression model is trained using the training set.
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) are computed to evaluate the model's performance.
5.	Visualization:
o	A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales is generated to assess the prediction quality.
6.	Future Predictions:
o	The model predicts sales for new data points provided as input.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROJECT:
Prerequisites:
1.	Python installed (3.8 or higher recommended).
2.	Libraries: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
o	pandas
o	matplotlib
o	scikit-learn
You can install them using:
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:
1.	Set Up Your Data:
o	Save your dataset (e.g., market_sales_data.csv) in the working directory.
o	Ensure it has the following columns: Price, Advertising_Budget, Seasonality, Sales.
2.	Run the Script:
o	Copy the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., sales_prediction.py).
o	Update the data dictionary or replace it with a data-loading function:
df = pd.read_csv("market_sales_data.csv")
3.	Execute the Script:
o	Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
python sales_prediction.py
4.	Analyze Output:
o	The script will display:
	Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics in the console.
	A scatter plot comparing actual and predicted sales.
	Predicted future sales for the provided future data.
5.	Test with Future Data:
o	Update the future_data DataFrame with new values:
future_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Price': [new_price_1, new_price_2],
    'Advertising_Budget': [new_budget_1, new_budget_2],
    'Seasonality': [new_seasonality_1, new_seasonality_2]
})
o	Re-run the script to see predictions for new scenarios.

NOTES:
•	Model Limitations:
o	The model assumes a linear relationship between features and sales.
o	Ensure features are preprocessed (e.g., normalized or encoded if necessary) for more complex datasets.
•	Customizations:
o	Experiment with feature selection or alternative machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) for better predictions.
